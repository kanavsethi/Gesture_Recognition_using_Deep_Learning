# Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning üëãü§ñ

## Problem Statement üìú

Gesture recognition is a fascinating application of deep learning, and this project focuses on recognizing five distinct hand gestures using a webcam as the input source. The system captures a sequence of images from the webcam, allowing it to accurately identify and classify the user's gestures. This technology can find applications in various domains, including sign language recognition, human-computer interaction, and more.

## Approach üõ†Ô∏è

To tackle the gesture recognition problem, two deep learning architectures were used for training:

1. **3-D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) Approach**: This approach leverages a 3D CNN model to analyze the features of the image sequences. It can capture motion information effectively and is faster to train than the CNN-RNN approach.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) Approach**: This approach combines the power of CNNs for spatial feature extraction with RNNs to handle sequential data. It is suitable for recognizing gestures as a sequence of images.

Both approaches are implemented using TensorFlow Keras.
